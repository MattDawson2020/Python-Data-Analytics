## üêç Python-Data-Analytics

- Third example project from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Series of basic webapps using Pandas and and JustPy to extract data from a 45000 row excel CSV file and render it as more readable charts/ graphs
- Began with using Jupyter Notebook as practice to extract and render data using MatPlotLib to gain a better understanding of how pandas can extract and process data
- Charts themselves are HighCharts templates, with the interior JS code replaced before render with Python data objects


## üìì Comments

- This exercise really displayed the power of Python language and Libraries, as it was relatively simple to take overwhelming and impenetrable datasets and turn them into usable information
- This iteration of the app is a basic tutorial, and not necessarily how I would want to make this app in a real application. The next step would be to have a single page and let users select the dataset/ graph type and have it dynamically change
- The tutorials skipped over some of the housekeeping/ cleanup tasks in the earlier videos at a time when it was unclear how to do it myself, so there may be some odd artifacts leftover, these will be cleaned up in a future iteration


## üíª Running the app

- Clone this repo to your local machine, navigate to the directory, choose which app/ graph you want to open by typing one of the following into your command line:
    * ``` python 0-simple-app.py ```
    * ``` python 1-av-rat-day.py ```
    * ``` python 2-av-rat-week.py ```
    * ``` python 3-av-rat-month.py ```
    * ``` python 4-av-rat-crs-mon.py ```
    * ``` python 5-av-rat-crs-mon-stream.py ```
    * ``` python 6-av-rat-day-of-week.py ```
    * ``` python 7-rat-crs-pie.py ```
- Your terminal will confirm when the hosting is successful and provide a link ( eg http://127.0.0.1:8000 ) that you can alt-click to open the browser
- From here you can see the dataset in a more visual and interactive way
